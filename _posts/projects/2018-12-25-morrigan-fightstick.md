My fianc√© and I really enjoy playing fighting games together, but she didn't
have a high quality fightstick to play on. For Christmas I made her a custom fightstick based on her favorite character, Morrigan. Below are the specs along with a look into the process.

I etched a pattern of bats with a laser cutter in the the outside panels.
On the inside of the stick, I laser etched a morrigan illustration from a Darkstalkers Art Book.
