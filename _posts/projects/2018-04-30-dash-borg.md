<p>
For our capstone project, my team and I were tasked to create a web application,
leveraging chrome's new web bluetooth api, that could interface with Dash Robotic's,
a robotic's company, bug-like bots. The main goal of the application was to create
a fun and educational experience for children looking to learn about programming.

One of the main goals was to create a free-drive controller page, where the user can freely control the bot via the web app. Our other main requirement was to make a GUI scripting page, where kids could program commands for the bot to perform.
</p>

<h2>Architecture</h2>
<p>
Since we wanted the site to work as a single page app we went with VueJS for our frontend framework. For receiving and sending information to the bots we utilized chrome's then recently released web bluetooth api. For our GUI scripting page we utilized Blockly, a visual programmign library create by Google which allows connective blocks to be composed and translated into an executable program.
</p>

<h2>Features</h2>
<h3>Free Drive Mode</h3>
<p>
We created a free-drive controller that allowed users to control the bot via
wasd or a joystick interface. Along with movement, we added a power slider, color
customization, and macros which would light up the bot and have it dance around.

<h3>GUI Scripting Mode</h3>
<p>
The GUI scripting page allows users to create a series of actions for the bot to perform.
Users can navigate through a selection of blocks and then drag them onto a workspace to be executed.

<p>
This mode provided the most technical challenges. We had to create custom blocks using chrome's Blockly api that translated to promise-based running code, allowing for asynchronous bluetooth commands to be performed while maintaining order in the program.

The team and I had a blast while working on this project. We were able to ride the line
between web and embedded applications. We were also able to create something that's one of the first of its kind.
Our success relied heavily on utilizing open-source libraries and developer tools that allowed
us to focus purely on application specific problems. If you're interested in learning more about Web Bluetooth, you can check out Google's article about the api.
