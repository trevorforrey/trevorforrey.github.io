After reading the book, _The Go Programming Language_, I had a strong itch to make something using Go.
I ended up deciding on creating a web crawler, with the attempt to build something
that fully took advantage of Golang's concurrency primitives. This project is loosely
based from a crawler example in the book. Read on to learn about my process in
creating this crawler and some problems I faced during my first Go program.

The project I worked towards was a web crawler that would output images found
while crawling. This project seemed fun from a user-experience standpoint as well
as being a practical application.

To gain a better understanding of how much of an improvement Go routines would have
on my project, I decided to first start writing a non-concurrent, single threaded
version of my crawler. The overall structure was done recursively:

{% highlight go %}
func crawl(urls []string, depth int) []string {

	depth--
	if depth == 0 {
		fmt.Println("Reached depth of zero")
		return emptyList
	}

	for _, link := range urls {
		fmt.Println(link)
		pageImgs, err := extractImgs(link)

		if err != nil {
			fmt.Print(err)
			continue
		}

		resultImgs = append(resultImgs, pageImgs...)
		newUrls, err := extractLinks(link)

		if err != nil {
			fmt.Print(err)
			continue
		}
		resultUrls = append(newUrls, crawl(newUrls, depth)...)
	}
	return resultUrls
}
{% endhighlight %}

This got the job done, but it was pretty slow. For my first step in improvements, I created
a basic pipeline design for my web crawler. My pipeline architecture consisted of
3 main go routines: a _Crawler_, a _Filter_ and an _Image Eater_. The Crawler's job
is to read an url from it's receiving (input) channel, and return the new links found
on the page on it's sending (output) channel. As it crawls through every node on a site
looking for links, it also sends images found to the Image Eating routine. The Filter
reads in links from its input channel, and determines if the link has already been searched.
If it has been searched, the filter doesn't send the link forward. The Image Eating routine
reads all available images that are sent to it.

{% highlight go %}
// send starting links to worklist
baseChan := gen(baseLinks)
firstDiscovered := crawler(baseChan, images, writer)
nextSet := filter(firstDiscovered, seenLinks)
secondDiscovered := crawler(nextSet, images, writer)
finalOutput := filter(secondDiscovered, seenLinks)

// Then consume output
for linkList := range finalOutput {
	for _, link := range linkList {
		resultVars.Links = append(resultVars.Links, link.Url)
	}
}
{% endhighlight %}

Changing to a pipelining architecture improved my project and brought crawling on
my github profile down to 27 seconds.

Finally, after getting my pipelining design working, I was able to start adding
multiple crawler routines and filter routines to quickly read off of the same input
channel, which greatly increased the efficiency of my image crawler.

{% highlight go %}
// Set up pipelines
baseChan := gen(baseLinks)
crawl1Chan := speedyCrawl(baseChan, images, writer)
filter1Chan := speedyFilter(crawl1Chan, seenLinks)
crawl2Chan := speedyMerge( // 7 crawling functions)
finalOutput := speedyFilter(crawl2Chan, seenLinks)

// Consume output
for outputLink := range finalOutput {
	resultVars.Links = append(resultVars.Links, outputLink.Url)
}
{% endhighlight %}

Adding multiple crawlers and filters improved the performance of my crawler from
27 seconds to 4 seconds.

There are a lot of improvements that are still left to make on this image crawler.
With the excitement of getting a concurrent program working, I let some error-handling
pass by, which I'll be adding in soon. Since making this project I've also worked a lot in
VueJS. I'm hoping to make the frontend a lot prettier.

Thanks for reading about this Gopher's first project! Expect to have more
Golang projects coming up!!
