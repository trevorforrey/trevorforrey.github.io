[_Learning Go Through Illustrations_](https://medium.com/@trevor4e/learning-gos-concurrency-through-illustrations-8c4aff603b3) is an article I wrote to help teach
Go's concurrency primitives to more visual learners (like myself). It also gave me an excuse to draw
a bunch of Gophers! In the article, I cover: go routines, channels, and the common concurrency gotchas that Go has.

If you want to learn about Go, or see some cute gophers, feel free to check it out!
