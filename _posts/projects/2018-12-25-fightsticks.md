# Darkstalkers Themed Stick (2019)

My fianc√© and I really enjoy playing fighting games together, but she didn't
have a high quality fightstick to play on. For Christmas I made her a custom fightstick based on her favorite character, Morrigan. Below are the specs along with a look into the process.

I etched a pattern of bats with a laser cutter in the the outside panels.
On the inside of the stick, I laser etched a morrigan illustration from a Darkstalkers Art Book.

# Street Fighter Themed Stick (2016)

A couple years ago, I got really into Street Fighter: Third Strike. I got hooked playing
one summer with my now Fiancee. Playing Third Strike really opened me up to the world of fighting games. With the announcement of Street Fighter V coming around
this time, I delved deeper into the hardware side of fighting games.

With my anticipation for SFV at an all-time high, I decided to make a custom
fight stick. Here are some pictures of the process and the final result.

Throughout this project I was able to learn a lot about prototyping tools. It was
also nice being able to do some graphic design for the collage on the face of
the stick. When I made this I was pretty crazy about Street Fighter and I'm glad
I was able to learn something and be productive through my excitement of the series.
